</div>


<div class='cap'>ACCORDING to the opinion commonly
entertained respecting an
author's want of riches, it may be
allowed us to say that we retain from
childhood a considerable notion of "a
ride in a coach." Nor do we hesitate to
confess, that by coach we especially mean
a hired one; from the equivocal dignity
of the post-chaise, down to that despised
old castaway, the hackney.</div>

<p>It is true that the carriage, as it is indifferently
called (as if nothing less genteel
could carry any one), is a more decided
thing than the chaise; it may be swifter
even than the mail, leaves the stage at a
still greater distance in every respect, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
(forgetting what it may come to itself)
darts by the poor old lumbering hackney
with immeasureable contempt.</p>

<p>It rolls with a prouder ease than any
other vehicle. It is full of cushions and
comfort; elegantly coloured inside and
out; rich, yet neat; light and rapid, yet
substantial. The horses seem proud to
draw it. The fat and fair-wigged coachman
"lends his sounding lash," his arm
only in action and that but little, his body
well set with its own weight.</p>

<p>The footman, in the pride of his nonchalance,
holding by the straps behind,
and glancing down sideways betwixt his
cocked-hat and neckcloth, stands swinging
from east to west upon his springy toes.</p>

<p>The horses rush along amidst their
glancing harness. Spotted dogs leap about
them, barking with a princely superfluity
of noise. The hammer-cloth trembles
through all its fringe. The paint flashes
in the sun.</p>

<p>We, contemptuous of everything less
convenient, bow backwards and forwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
with a certain indifferent air of gentility,
infinitely predominant.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a happy mixture of
turbulence and truth, the carriage dashes
up by the curb-stone to the very point
desired, and stops with a lordly wilfulness
of decision. The coachman looks as if
nothing had happened. The footman is
down in an instant; the knocker reverberates
into the farthest corner of the house;
doors, both carriage and house, are open;&mdash;we
descend, casting a matter-of-course
eye at the bystanders; and the moment
we touch the pavement, the vehicle, as if
conscious of what it has carried, and relieved
from the weight of our importance,
recovers from its sidelong inclination with a
jerk, tossing and panting, as it were, for very
breath, like the proud heads of the horses.</p>

<p>All this, it must be owned, is very
pretty; but it is also gouty and superfluous.
It is too convenient,&mdash;too exacting,&mdash;too
exclusive. We must get too
much for it, and lose too much by it. Its
plenty, as Ovid says, makes us poor. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
neither have it in the republic of letters,
nor would desire it in any less jacobinical
state. Horses, as many as you please,
provided men have enough to eat; hired
coaches, a reasonable number:&mdash;but health
and good-humour at all events.</p>

<p>Gigs and curricles are things less objectionable,
because they cannot be so
relied upon as substitutes for exercise.
Our taste in them, we must confess, is not
genuine. How shall we own it? We
like to be driven, instead of drive;&mdash;to
read or look about us, instead of keeping
watch on a horse's head. We have no
relish even for vehicles of this description
that are not safe. Danger is a good thing
for giving a fillip to a man's ideas; but
even danger, to us, must come recommended
by something useful. We have
no ambition to have <span class="smcap">Tandem</span> written on
our tombstone.</p>

<p>The prettiest of these vehicles is the
curricle, which is also the safest. There
is something worth looking at in the pair
of horses, with that sparkling pole of steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
laid across them. It is like a bar of music,
comprising their harmonious course.</p>

<p>But to us, even gigs are but a sort of
unsuccessful run at gentility. The driver,
to all intents and purposes, had better be
on the horse. Horseback is the noblest
way of being carried in the world. It is
cheaper than any other mode of riding;
it is common to all ranks; and it is manly,
graceful, and healthy. The handsomest
mixture of danger with dignity, in the
shape of a carriage, was the tall phaeton
with its yellow wings. We remember
looking up to it with respect in our childhood,
partly for its loftiness, partly for its
name, and partly for the show it makes in
the prints to novels of that period. The
most gallant figure which modern driving
ever cut was in the person of a late Duke
of Hamilton; of whom we have read or
heard somewhere, that he used to dash
round the streets of Rome, with his horses
panting, and his hounds barking about his
phaeton, to the equal fright and admiration
of the Masters of the World, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
accustomed to witness nothing higher than
a lumbering old coach, or a cardinal on a
mule.</p>

<p>A post-chaise involves the idea of
travelling, which in the company of those
we love is home in motion. The smooth
running along the road, the fresh air, the
variety of scene, the leafy roads, the bursting
prospects, the clatter through a town,
the gaping gaze of a village, the hearty
appetite, the leisure (your chaise waiting
only upon your own movements), even the
little contradictions to home-comfort, and
the expedients upon which they set us, all
put the animal spirits at work, and throw a
novelty over the road of life.</p>

<p>If anything could grind us young again,
it would be the wheels of a post-chaise.
The only monotonous sight is the perpetual
up-and-down movement of the postillion,
who, we wish exceedingly, could take a
chair. His occasional retreat to the bar
which occupies the place of a box, and
his affecting to sit upon it, only remind us
of its exquisite want of accommodation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
But some have given the bar, lately, a
surreptitious squeeze in the middle, and
flattened it a little into something obliquely
resembling an inconvenient seat.</p>

<p>If we are to believe the merry Columbus
of Down-Hall, calashes, now almost obsolete
for any purpose, used to be hired
for travelling occasions a hundred years
back; but he preferred a chariot; and
neither was good. Yet see how pleasantly
good humour rides over its inconveniences.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Then answer'd 'Squire Morley, "Pray get a calash,<br />
That in summer may burn, and in winter may splash;<br />
I love dirt and dust; and 'tis always my pleasure<br />
To take with me much of the soil that I measure."<br />
<br />
But Matthew thought better; for Matthew thought right,<br />
And hired a chariot so trim and so tight,<br />
That extremes both of winter and summer might pass;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>For one window was canvas, the other was glass.<br />
<br />
"Draw up," quoth friend Matthew; "Pull down," quoth friend John;<br />
"We shall be both hotter and colder anon."<br />
Thus, talking and scolding, they forward did speed;<br />
And Ralpho paced by under Newman the Swede.<br />
<br />
Into an old inn did this equipage roll,<br />
At a town they call Hodson, the sign of the Bull;<br />
Near a nymph with an urn that divides the highway,<br />
And into a puddle throws mother of tea.<br />
<br />
"Come here, my sweet landlady, pray how d'ye do?<br />
Where is Cicely so cleanly, and Prudence, and Sue?<br />
And where is the widow that dwelt here below?<br />
And the hostler that sung about eight years ago?<br />
<br />
And where is your sister, so mild and so dear,<br />
Whose voice to her maids like a trumpet was clear?"<br />
"By my troth," she replies, "you grow younger, I think:<br />
And pray, sir, what wine does the gentleman drink?<br />
<br />
"Why now let me die, sir, or live upon trust,<br />
If I know to which question to answer you first:<br />
Why, things, since I saw you, most strangely have varied;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>The hostler is hang'd, and the widow is married.<br />
<br />
"And Prue left a child for the parish to nurse,<br />
And Cicely went off with a gentleman's purse;<br />
And as to my sister, so mild and so dear,<br />
She has lain in the churchyard full many a year."<br />
<br />
"Well; peace to her ashes! What signifies grief?<br />
She roasted red veal, and she powder'd lean beef:<br />
Full nicely she knew to cook up a fine dish;<br />
For tough were her pullets, and tender her fish."<br />

<p>This quotation reminds us of a little
poem by the same author, entitled the
<cite>Secretary</cite>, which, as it is short, and runs
upon chaise-wheels, and seems to have
slipped the notice it deserves, we will do
ourselves the pleasure of adding. It was
written when he was Secretary of Embassy
at the Hague, where he seems to have
edified the Dutch with his insisting upon
enjoying himself. The astonishment with
which the good Hollander and his wife
look up to him as he rides, and the touch
of yawning dialect at the end, are extremely
pleasant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>If Prior had been living now he would
have found the greatest want of travelling
accommodation in a country for whose
more serious wants we have to answer,
without having her wit to help us to an
excuse. There is a story told of an Irish
post-chaise, the occupier of which, without
quitting it, had to take to his heels.
It was going down hill as fast as wind
and the impossibility of stopping could
make it, when the foot passengers observed
a couple of legs underneath,
emulating, with all their might, the rapidity
of the wheels. The bottom had
come out; and the gentleman was obliged
to run for his life.</p>

<p>We must relate another anecdote of an
Irish post-chaise, merely to show the
natural tendencies of the people to be
lawless in self-defence. A friend of ours,
who was travelling among them, used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
have this proposition put to him by the
postillion whenever he approached a turnpike&mdash;"Plase
your honour, will I drive
at the pike?" The pike hung loosely
across the road. Luckily, the rider happened
to be of as lawless a turn for justice
as the driver, so the answer was always a
cordial one&mdash;"Oh yes&mdash;drive at the
pike." The pike made way accordingly;
and in a minute or two the gate people
were heard and seen, screaming in vain
after the illegal charioteers.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Fertur equis auriga, neque audit currus."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;"><span class="smcap">Virgil.</span></span><br />
<br />
"The driver's borne beyond their swearing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the post-chaise is hard of hearing."</span><br />
</div>

<p>As to following them, nobody in Ireland
thinks of moving too much, legal or
illegal.</p>

<p>The pleasure to be had in a mail-coach
is not so much at one's command as that
in a post-chaise. There is generally too
little room in it, and too much hurry out
of it. The company must not lounge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
over their breakfast, even if they are all
agreed. It is an understood thing that
they are to be uncomfortably punctual.
They must get in at seven o'clock, though
they are all going upon business they do
not like or care about, or will have to wait
till nine before they can do anything.
Some persons know how to manage this
haste, and breakfast and dine in the cracking
of a whip. They stick with their
fork, they joint, they sliver, they bolt.
Legs and wings vanish before them like
a dragon's before a knight-errant. But if
one is not a clergyman or a regular jolly
fellow, one has no chance this way. To
be diffident or polite is fatal. It is a merit
eagerly acknowledged, and as quickly set
aside. At last you begin upon a leg, and
are called off.</p>

<p>A very troublesome degree of science is
necessary for being well settled in the
coach. We remember travelling in our
youth, upon the north road, with an orthodox
elderly gentleman of venerable peruke,
who talked much with a grave-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
young man about universities, and won
our inexperienced heart with a notion
that he was deep in Horace and Virgil.
He was deeper in his wig.</p>

<p>Towards evening, as he seemed restless,
we asked with much diffidence
whether a change, even for the worse,
might not relieve him; for we were
riding backwards, and thought that all
elderly people disliked that way. He
insinuated the very objection; so we recoiled
from asking him again.</p>

<p>In a minute or two, however, he insisted
that we were uneasy ourselves, and
that he must relieve us for our own sake.
We protested as filially as possible against
this; but at last, out of mere shame of
disputing the point with so benevolent an
elder, we changed seats with him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="364" height="600" alt="The Post-Chaise" />
</div>

<p>After an interval of bland meditation,
we found the evening sun full in our face.
His new comfort set him dozing; and
every now and then he jerked his wig in
our eyes, till we had the pleasure of seeing
him take out a nightcap and look very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a><br /><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
ghastly. The same person, and his serious
young companion, tricked us out of a
good bed we happened to get at the inn.</p>

<p>The greatest peculiarity attending a
mail-coach arises from its travelling at
night. The gradual decline of talk, the
incipient snore, the rustling and shifting
of legs and nightcaps, the cessation of
other noises on the road&mdash;the sound of the
wind or rain, of the moist circuit of
the wheels, and of the time-beating tread
of the horses&mdash;all dispose the traveller,
who cannot sleep, to a double sense of the
little that is left him to observe.</p>

<p>The coach stops, the door opens, a
rush of cold air announces the demands
and merits of the guard, who is taking
his leave, and is anxious to remember us.
The door is clapped to again; the sound
of everything outside becomes dim; and
voices are heard knocking up the people
of the inn, and answered by issuing yawns
and excuses. Wooden shoes clog heavily
about. The horses' mouths are heard,
swilling the water out of tubs. All is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
still again, and some one in the coach
takes a long breath. The driver mounts,
and we resume our way.</p>

<p>It happens that we can sleep anywhere
except in a mail-coach; so that we hate
to see a prudent, warm, old fellow, who
has been eating our fowls and intercepting
our toast, put on his night-cap in order to
settle himself till morning. We rejoice
in the digs that his neighbour's elbow gives
him, and hail the long-legged traveller
that sits opposite.</p>

<p>A passenger of our wakeful description
must try to content himself with listening
to the sounds above mentioned; or thinking
of his friends; or turning verses, as
Sir Richard Blackmore did, "to the
rumbling of his coach's wheels."</p>

<p>The stage-coach is a great and unpretending
accommodation. It is a cheap
substitute, notwithstanding all its eighteen-penny
and two-and-sixpenny temptations,
for keeping a carriage or a horse; and
we really think, in spite of its gossiping,
is no mean help to village liberality; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
its passengers are so mixed, so often varied,
so little yet so much together, so compelled
to accommodate, so willing to pass
a short time pleasantly, and so liable to
the criticism of strangers, that it is hard if
they do not get a habit of speaking, or
even thinking more kindly of one another
than if they mingled less often, or under
other circumstances.</p>

<p>The old and infirm are treated with
reverence; the ailing sympathised with;
the healthy congratulated; the rich not
distinguished; the poor well met; the
young, with their faces conscious of ride,
patronised, and allowed to be extra.</p>

<p>Even the fiery, nay the fat, learn to
bear with each other; and if some high-thoughted
persons will talk now and then
of their great acquaintances, or their preference
of a carriage, there is an instinct
which tells the rest that they would not
make such appeals to their good opinion
if they valued it so little as might be supposed.
Stoppings and dust are not pleasant,
but the latter may be had on grander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
occasions; and if anyone is so unlucky
as never to keep another stopping himself,
he must be content with the superiority of
his virtue.</p>

<p>The mail or stage-coachman, upon the
whole, is no inhuman mass of great-coat,
gruffness, civility, and old boots. The
latter is the politer, from the smaller
range of acquaintance, and his necessity
for preserving them.</p>

<p>His face is red, and his voice rough, by
the same process of drink and catarrh.
He has a silver watch with a steel-chain,
and plenty of loose silver in his pocket,
mixed with half-pence. He serves the
houses he goes by for a clock. He takes
a glass at every alehouse; for thirst, when
it is dry, and for warmth when it is wet.</p>

<p>He likes to show the judicious reach of
his whip, by twigging a dog or a goose on
the road, or children that get in the way.
His tenderness to descending old ladies is
particular. He touches his hat to Mr.
Smith. He gives "the young woman"
a ride, and lends her his box-coat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
rain. His liberality in imparting his
knowledge to any one that has the good
fortune to ride on the box with him is a
happy mixture of deference, conscious
possession, and familiarity. His information
chiefly lies in the occupancy of houses
on the road, prize-fighters, Bow Street
runners, and accidents.</p>

<p>He concludes that you know Dick
Sams, or Old Joey, and proceeds to relate
some of the stories that relish his pot and
tobacco in the evening. If any of the
four-in-hand gentry go by, he shakes his
head, and thinks they might find something
better to do. His contempt for
them is founded on modesty.</p>

<p>He tells you that his off-hand horse is
as pretty a goer as ever was, but that
Kitty&mdash;"Yeah, now there, Kitty, can't
you be still? Kitty's a devil, sir, for all
you wouldn't think it." He knows that
the boys on the road admire him, and gives
the horses an indifferent lash with his
whip as they go by. If you wish to
know what rain and dust can do, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
should look at his old hat. There is an
indescribably placid and paternal look in
the position of his corduroy knees and old
top-boots on the foot-board, with their
pointed toes and never-cleaned soles. His
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau-idéal</i> of appearance is a frock-coat,
with mother-o'-pearl buttons, a striped
yellow waistcoat, and a flower in his
mouth.</p>

<div class='unindent'>Is the quadrijugal virtue of that learned
person still extant? That Olympic and
Baccalaureated charioteer?&mdash;That best

<p>We had once the pleasure of being
beaten by him in that capital art, he
having brought up against us an unusual
number of those cross-armed letters, as
puzzling to verse-cappers as iron-cats unto
cavalry, ycleped X's; which said warfare
he was pleased to call to mind in after
times, unto divers of our comrades.</p>

<p>The modest and natural greatness with
which he used to say "Yait" to his
horses, and then turn round with his rosy
gills, and an eye like a fish, and give out
the required verse, can never pass away
from us, as long as verses or horses run.</p>

<p>Of the hackney-coach we cannot make
as short work as many persons like to
make of it in reality. Perhaps it is partly
a sense of the contempt it undergoes,
which induces us to endeavour to make
the best of it. But it has its merits, as we
shall show presently. In the account of
its demerits we have been anticipated by a
new, and we are sorry to say a very good,
poetess, of the name of Lucy V&mdash;&mdash;
L&mdash;&mdash;, who has favoured us with a sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of a manuscript poem, in which they are
related with great nicety and sensitiveness.</p>

<p><i>Reader.</i> What, sir, sorry to say that a
lady is a good poetess?</p>

<p><i>Indicator.</i> Only inasmuch, madam, as
the lady gives such authority to the anti-social
view of this subject, and will not
agree with us as to the beatitude of the
hackney-coach.&mdash;But hold:&mdash;upon turning
to the manuscript again, we find that
the objections are put into the mouth of a
dandy courtier. This makes a great difference.
The hackney resumes all which
it had lost in the good graces of the fair
authoress. The only wonder is, how the
courtier could talk so well. Here is the
passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Eban, untempted by the Pastry-cooks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">(Of Pastry he got store within the Palace),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With hasty steps, wrapp'd cloak, and solemn looks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Incognito upon his errand sallies;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His smelling-bottle ready for the alleys;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He pass'd the Hurdy-gurdies with disdain,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just as he made his vow, it 'gan to rain,</span><br />
Therefore he call'd a coach, and bade it drive amain.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'I'll pull the string,' said he, and further said,</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Philosophising thus, he pull'd the check,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bade the coachman wheel to such a street;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who turning much his body, more his neck,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Louted full low, and hoarsely did him greet."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The tact here is so nice of the infirmities
which are but too likely to beset our poor
old friend, that we should only spoil it to
say more. To pass then to the merits.</div>

<p>One of the greatest helps to a sense or
merit in other things is a consciousness of
one's own wants. Do you despise a
hackney-coach? Get tired; get old;
get young again. Lay down your carriage,
or make it less uneasily too easy.
Have to stand up half-an-hour, out of a
storm, under a gateway. Be ill, and wish
to visit a friend who is worse. Fall in
love, and want to sit next your mistress.
Or if all this will not do, fall in a cellar.</p>

<p>Ben Jonson, in a fit of indignation at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the niggardliness of James the First, exclaimed,
"He despises me, I suppose,
because I live in an alley:&mdash;tell him his
soul lives in an alley." We think we see
a hackney-coach moving out of its ordinary
patience, and hear it say, "You
there, who sit looking so scornfully at me
out of your carriage, are yourself the
thing you take me for. Your understanding
is a hackney-coach. It is lumbering,
rickety, and at a stand. When it moves
it is drawn by things like itself. It is at
once the most stationary and the most
servile of commonplaces. And when a
good thing is put into it, it does not know
it."</p>

<p>But it is difficult to imagine a hackney-coach
under so irritable an aspect.
Hogarth has drawn a set of hats or wigs
with countenances of their own. We
have noticed the same thing in the faces
of houses; and it sometimes gets in one's
way in a landscape-painting, with the outlines
of the rocks and trees.</p>

<p>A friend tells us that the hackney-coach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
has its countenance, with gesticulation
besides: and now he has pointed it
out, we can easily fancy it. Some of
them look chucked under the chin, some
nodding, some coming at you sideways.
We shall never find it easy, however, to
fancy the irritable aspect above-mentioned.</p>

<p>A hackney-coach always appeared to
us the most quiescent of movables. Its
horses and it, slumbering on a stand, are
an emblem of all patience in creation,
animate and inanimate.</p>

<p>The submission with which the coach
takes every variety of the weather, dust,
rain, and wind, never moving but when
some eddying blast makes its old body
shiver, is only surpassed by the vital
patience of the horses.</p>

<p>Can anything better illustrate the poet's
line about</p>

<div class='center'>
"&mdash;Years that bring the philosophic mind,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>than the still-hung head, the dim indifferent
eye, the dragged and blunt-cornered
mouth, and the gaunt imbecility of body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dropping its weight on three tired legs in
order to give repose to the lame one?
When it has blinkers on, they seem to be
shutting up its eyes for death, like the
windows of a house. Fatigue and the
habit of suffering have become as natural
to the creature as the bit to its mouth.</div>

<p>Once in half-an-hour it moves the position
of its leg, or shakes its drooping ears.
The whip makes it go, more from habit
than from pain. Its coat has become
almost callous to minor stings. The blind
and staggering fly in autumn might come
to die against its cheek.</p>

<p>Of a pair of hackney-coach horses, one
so much resembles the other that it seems
unnecessary for them to compare notes.
They have that within them which is
beyond the comparative. They no longer
bend their heads towards each other as
they go. They stand together as if unconscious
of one another's company. But
they are not.</p>

<p>An old horse misses his companion, like
an old man. The presence of an associate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
who has gone through pain and
suffering with us, need not say anything.
It is talk, and memory, and everything.
Something of this it may be to our old
friends in harness. What are they thinking
of while they stand motionless in the
rain? Do they remember? Do they
dream? Do they still, unperplexed as their
old blood is by too many foods, receive a
pleasure from the elements; a dull refreshment
from the air and sun? Have they
yet a palate for the hay which they pull so
feebly? or for the rarer grain which induces
them to perform their only voluntary
gesture of any vivacity, and toss up the
bags that are fastened on their mouths, to
get at its shallow feast?</p>

<p>If the old horse were gifted with
memory (and who shall say he is not, in
one thing as well as another?), it might be
at once the most melancholy and pleasantest
faculty he has; for the commonest
hack has probably been a hunter or racer;
has had his days of lustre and enjoyment;
has darted along the course, and scoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the pasture; has carried his master
proudly, or his lady gently; has pranced,
has galloped, has neighed aloud, has
dared, has forded, has spurned at mastery,
has graced it and made it proud, has rejoiced
the eye, has been crowded to as an
actor, has been all instinct with life and
quickness, has had his very fear admired as
courage, and been sat upon by valour as its
chosen seat.</p>

<p>Alas! his only riders now are the rain
and a sordid harness. The least utterance
of the wretchedest voice makes him
stop and become a fixture. His loves
were in existence at the time the old
sign, fifty miles hence, was painted. His
nostrils drink nothing but what they cannot
help&mdash;the water out of an old tub.
Not all the hounds in the world could
make his ears attain any eminence. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
mane is scratchy and lax. The same
great poet who wrote the triumphal verses
for him and his loves, has written their
living epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"The poor jades</span><br />
Lob down their heads, dropping the hide and hips,<br />
The gum down roping from their pale dead eyes;<br />
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit<br />
Lies foul with chew'd grass, still and motionless."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;"><cite>K. Henry V, Act 1.</cite></span><br />
</div>

<p>There is a song called the "High-mettled
Racer," describing the progress
of a favourite horse's life, from its time of
vigour and glory, down to its furnishing
food for the dogs. It is not as good as
Shakespeare; but it will do to those who
are half as kind as he.</p>

<p>We defy anybody to read that song, or
be in the habit of singing it or hearing it
sung, and treat horses as they are sometimes
treated. So much good may an
author do, who is in earnest, and does not
go in a pedantic way to work.</p>

<p>We will not say that Plutarch's good-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>natured
observation about taking care of
one's old horse did more for that class of
retired servants than all the graver lessons
of philosophy. For it is philosophy
which first sets people thinking; and then
some of them put it in a more popular
shape. But we will venture to say that
Plutarch's observation saved many a steed
of antiquity a superfluous thump; and in
this respect the author of the "High-mettled
Racer" (Mr. Dibdin we believe,
no mean man in his way) may stand by
the side of the old illustrious biographer.</p>

<p>Next to ancient causes, to the inevitable
progress of events, and to the practical
part of Christianity (which persons, the
most accused of irreligion, have preserved
like a glorious infant, through ages of
blood and fire) the kindliness of modern
philosophy is more immediately owing to
the great national writers of Europe, in
whose schools we have all been children:&mdash;to
Voltaire in France, and Shakespeare
in England. Shakespeare, in his time,
obliquely pleaded the cause of the Jew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and got him set on a common level with
humanity. The Jew has since been not
only allowed to be human, but some have
undertaken to show him as the "best
good Christian though he knows it not."</p>

<p>We shall not dispute the title with him,
nor with the other worshippers of Mammon,
who force him to the same shrine.
We allow, as things go in that quarter,
that the Jew is as great a Christian as his
neighbour, and his neighbour as great a
Jew as he. There is neither love nor
money lost between them.</p>

<p>But, at all events, the Jew is a man;
and with Shakespeare's assistance the time
has arrived when we can afford to acknowledge
the horse for a fellow-creature, and
treat him as one. We may say for him,
upon the same grounds and to the same
purpose, as Shakespeare said for the
Israelite, "Hath not a horse organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions?
hurt with the same weapons, subject to
the same diseases, healed by the same
means, warmed and cooled by the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
winter and summer, as a Christian is?"
Oh&mdash;but some are always at hand to cry
out&mdash;it would be effeminate to think too
much of these things!&mdash;Alas! we have
no notion of asking the gentlemen to
think too much of anything. If they
will think at all, it will be a great gain.</p>

<p>As to effeminacy (if we must use that
ungallant and partial word, for want of a
better) it is cruelty that is effeminate. It
is selfishness that is effeminate. Anything
is effeminate which would get an
excitement, or save a proper and manly
trouble, at the undue expense of another.
How does the case stand then between
those who ill-treat their horses and those
who spare them?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="369" height="600" alt="THE STAGE-COACH DRIVER: man and womanon top of coach with driver" />
</div>

<p>To return to the coach. Imagine a
fine coach and pair, which are standing
at the door of a house, in all the pride of
their strength and beauty, converted into
what they may both become, a hackney,
and its old shamblers. Such is one of
the meditations of the philosophic eighteen-penny
rider. A hackney-coach has often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a><br /><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the arms of nobility on it. As we are
going to get into it we catch a glimpse of
the faded lustre of an earl's or marquis's
coronet, and think how many light and
proud hearts have ascended those now
rickety steps.</p>

<p>In this coach perhaps an elderly lady
once rode to her wedding, a blooming
and blushing girl. Her mother and sister
were on each side of her; the bridegroom
opposite in a blossom-coloured coat. They
talk of everything in the world of which
they are not thinking. The sister was
never prouder of her. The mother with
difficulty represses her own pride and
tears. The bride, thinking he is looking at
her, casts down her eyes, pensive in her joy.</p>

<p>The bridegroom is at once the proudest,
and the humblest, and the happiest man in
the world. For our parts, we sit in a
corner, and are in love with the sister.
We dream she is going to speak to us in
answer to some indifferent question, when
a hoarse voice comes in at the front window
and says, "Whereabouts, sir?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>And grief has consecrated thee, thou
reverend dilapidation, as well as joy!
Thou hast carried unwilling as well as
willing hearts; hearts that have thought
the slowest of thy paces too fast; faces
that have sat back in a corner of thee, to
hide their tears from the very thought of
being seen.</p>

<p>In thee the destitute have been taken
to the poor-house, and the wounded and
sick to the hospital; and many an arm
has been round many an insensible waist.
Into thee the friend or the lover has hurried,
in a passion of tears, to lament his
loss.</p>

<p>In thee he has hastened to condole the
dying or the wretched. In thee the
father, or mother, or the older kinswoman,
more patient in her years, has taken the
little child to the grave, the human jewel
that must be parted with.</p>

<p>But joy appears in thee again, like the
look-in of the sunshine. If the lover
has gone in thee unwillingly, he has also
gone willingly. How many friends hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
thou not carried to merry-meetings! How
many young parties to the play! How
many children, whose faces thou hast
turned in an instant from the extremity of
lachrymose weariness to that of staring
delight.</p>

<p>Thou hast contained as many different
passions in thee as a human heart; and
for the sake of the human heart, old
body, thou art venerable. Thou shalt be
as respectable as a reduced old gentleman,
whose very slovenliness is pathetic. Thou
shalt be made gay, as he is over a younger
and richer table, and thou shalt be still
more touching for the gaiety.</p>

<p>We wish the hackney-coachman were
as interesting a machine as either his
coach or horses; but it must be owned,
that of all the driving species he is the
least agreeable specimen. This is partly
to be attributed to the life which has most
probably put him into his situation; partly
to his want of outside passengers to cultivate
his gentility; and partly to the disputable
nature of his fare, which always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
leads him to be lying and cheating. The
waterman of the stand, who beats him in
sordidness of appearance, is more respectable.
He is less of a vagabond, and
cannot cheat you.</p>

<p>Nor is the hackney-coachman only
disagreeable in himself, but, like Falstaff
reversed, the cause of disagreeableness in
others; for he sets people upon disputing
with him in pettiness and ill-temper. He
induces the mercenary to be violent, and
the violent to seem mercenary. A man
whom you took for a pleasant, laughing
fellow, shall all of a sudden put on an
irritable look of calculation, and vow that
he will be charged with a constable rather
than pay the sixpence.</p>

<p>Even fair woman shall waive her all-conquering
softness, and sound a shrill
trumpet in reprobation of the extortionate
charioteer, whom, if she were a man, she
says, she would expose. Being a woman,
then, let her not expose herself. Oh, but
it is intolerable to be so imposed upon!
Let the lady, then, get a pocket-book, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
she must, with the hackney-coach fares in
it; or a pain in the legs, rather than the
temper; or, above all, let her get wiser,
and have an understanding that can dispense
with the good opinion of the hackney-coachman.
Does she think that her
rosy lips were made to grow pale about
two-and-sixpence; or that the expression
of them will ever be like her cousin
Fanny's if she goes on?</p>

<p>The stage-coachman likes the boys on
the road, because he knows they admire
him. The hackney-coachman knows that
they cannot admire him, and that they can
get up behind his coach, which makes
him very savage.</p>

<p>The cry of "Cut behind!" from the
malicious urchins on the pavement wounds
at once his self-love and his interest. He
would not mind overloading his master's
horses for another sixpence, but to do it
for nothing is what shocks his humanity.
He hates the boy for imposing upon him,
and the boys for reminding him that he
has been imposed upon; and he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
willingly twinge the cheeks of all nine.
The cut of his whip over the coach is
malignant.</p>

<p>He has a constant eye to the road behind
him. He has also an eye to what
may be left in the coach. He will undertake
to search the straw for you, and
miss the half-crown on purpose. He
speculates on what he may get above his
fare, according to your manners or company;
and knows how much to ask for
driving faster or slower than usual.</p>

<p>He does not like wet weather so much
as people suppose; for he says it rots both
his horses and harness, and he takes
parties out of town when the weather is
fine, which produces good payments in a
lump.</p>

<p>Lovers, late supper-eaters, and girls
going home from boarding-school, are his
best pay. He has a rascally air of remonstrance
when you dispute half the
overcharge, and according to the temper
he is in, begs you to consider his bread,
hopes you will not make such a fuss about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a trifle; or tells you, you may take his
number or sit in the coach all night.</p>

<p>A great number of ridiculous adventures
must have taken place in which
hackney-coaches were concerned. The
story of the celebrated harlequin Lunn,
who secretly pitched himself out of one
into a tavern window, and when the
coachman was about to submit to the loss
of his fare, astonished him by calling out
again from the inside, is too well known
for repetition.</p>

<p>There is one of Swift, not perhaps so
common. He was going, one dark evening,
to dine with some great man, and was
accompanied by some other clergymen, to
whom he gave their cue. They were all
in their canonicals. When they arrive at
the house, the coachman opens the door,
and lets down the steps. Down steps the
Dean, very reverend in his black robes;
after him comes another personage, equally
black and dignified; then another; then
a fourth. The coachman, who recollects
taking up no greater number, is about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
put up the steps, when another clergyman
descends. After giving way to this other,
he proceeds with great confidence to toss
them up, when lo! another comes. Well,
there cannot, he thinks, be more than six.
He is mistaken. Down comes a seventh,
then an eighth; then a ninth; all with
decent intervals; the coach, in the meantime,
rocking as if it were giving birth to
so many demons. The coachman can
conclude no less. He cries out, "The
devil! the devil!" and is preparing to
run away, when they all burst into laughter.
They had gone round as they
descended, and got in at the other door.</p>

<p>We remember in our boyhood an edifying
comment on the proverb of "all is
not gold that glistens." The spectacle
made such an impression upon us, that we
recollect the very spot, which was at the
corner of a road in the way from Westminster
to Kennington, near a stonemason's.
It was a severe winter, and we
were out on a holiday, thinking, perhaps,
of the gallant hardships to which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ancient soldiers accustomed themselves,
when we suddenly beheld a group of
hackney-coachmen, not, as Spenser says
of his witch,</p>

<div class='center'>
"Busy, as <em>seemed</em>, about some wicked gin,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>but pledging each other in what appeared
to us to be little glasses of cold water.
What temperance, thought we! What
extraordinary and noble content! What
more than Roman simplicity! Here are
a set of poor Englishmen, of the homeliest
order, in the very depth of winter,
quenching their patient and honourable
thirst with modicums of cold water! O
true virtue and courage! O sight worthy
of the Timoleons and Epaminondases!
We know not how long we remained in
this error; but the first time we recognised
the white devil for what it was&mdash;the
first time we saw through the crystal
purity of its appearance&mdash;was a great
blow to us.</div>

<p>We did not then know what the
drinkers went through; and this reminds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
us that we have omitted one great redemption
of the hackney-coachman's
character&mdash;his being at the mercy of all
chances and weathers.</p>

<p>Other drivers have their settled hours
and pay. He only is at the mercy of
every call and every casualty; he only is
dragged, without notice, like the damned
in Milton, into the extremities of wet and
cold, from his alehouse fire to the freezing
rain; he only must go anywhere, at what
hour and to whatever place you choose,
his old rheumatic limbs shaking under his
weight of rags, and the snow and sleet
beating into his puckered face, through
streets which the wind scours like a
channel.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>




<h2>NIGHT WATCHMEN</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE readers of these our lucubrations
need not be informed that we
keep no carriage. The consequence
is, that being visitors of the
theatre, and having some inconsiderate
friends who grow pleasanter and pleasanter
till one in the morning, we are great
walkers home by night; and this has
made us great acquaintances of watchmen,
moonlight, <em>mud</em>-light, and other
accompaniments of that interesting hour.
Luckily we are fond of a walk by night.
It does not always do us good; but that
is not the fault of the hour, but our own,
who ought to be stouter; and therefore
we extract what good we can out of our
necessity, with becoming temper. It is a
remarkable thing in nature, and one of
the good-naturedest things we know of
her, that the mere fact of looking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
us, and being conscious of what is going
on, is its own reward, if we do but
notice it in good-humour. Nature is a
great painter (and art and society are
among her works), to whose minutest
touches the mere fact of becoming alive
is to enrich the stock of our enjoyments.</div>

<p>We confess there are points liable to
cavil in a walk home by night in February.
Old umbrellas have their weak
sides; and the quantity of mud and rain
may surmount the picturesque. Mistaking
a soft piece of mud for hard, and
so filling your shoe with it, especially at
setting out, must be acknowledged to be
"aggravating." But then you ought to
have boots. There are sights, indeed, in
the streets of London, which can be
rendered pleasant by no philosophy;
things too grave to be talked about in our
present paper; but we must premise, that
our walk leads us out of town, and
through streets and suburbs of by no
means the worst description. Even there
we may be grieved if we will. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
farther the walk into the country, the
more tiresome we may choose to find it;
and when we take it purely to oblige
others, we must allow, as in the case of
a friend of ours, that generosity itself on
two sick legs may find limits to the notion
of virtue being its own reward, and reasonably
"curse those comfortable people"
who, by the lights in their windows, are
getting into their warm beds, and saying
to one another, "Bad thing to be out of
doors to-night."</p>

<p>Supposing, then, that we are in a reasonable
state of health and comfort in
other respects, we say that a walk home
at night has its merits, if you choose to
meet with them. The worst part of it is
the setting out; the closing of the door
upon the kind faces that part with you.
But their words and looks, on the other
hand, may set you well off. We have
known a word last us all the way home,
and a look make a dream of it. To a
lover, for instance, no walk can be bad.
He sees but one face in the rain and darkness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the same that he saw by the light
in the warm room. This ever accompanies
him, looking in his eyes; and if
the most pitiable and spoilt face in the
world should come between them, startling
him with the saddest mockery of
love, he would treat it kindly for her sake.
But this is a begging of the question. A
lover does not walk. He is sensible
neither to the pleasures nor pains of walking.
He treads on air; and in the thick
of all that seems inclement has an avenue
of light and velvet spread for him, like a
sovereign prince.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;">

</div>

<p>To resume, then, like men of this
world. The advantage of a late hour is,
that everything is silent and the people
fast in their beds. This gives the whole
world a tranquil appearance. Inanimate
objects are no calmer than passions and
cares now seem to be, all laid asleep. The
human being is motionless as the house or
the tree; sorrow is suspended; and you
endeavour to think that love only is
awake. Let not readers of true delicacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a><br /><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a><br /><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
be alarmed, for we mean to touch profanely
upon nothing that ought to be
sacred; and as we are for thinking the
best on these occasions, it is of the best
love we think; love of no heartless order,
and such only as ought to be awake with
the stars.</p>

<p>As to cares and curtain-lectures, and
such-like abuses of the tranquillity of
night, we call to mind, for their sakes, all
the sayings of the poets and others about
"balmy sleep," and the soothing of hurt
minds, and the weariness of sorrow, which
drops into forgetfulness. The great
majority are certainly "fast as a church"
by the time we speak of; and for the
rest, we are among the workers who have
been sleepless for their advantage; so we
take out our licence to forget them for the
time being. The only thing that shall
remind us of them is the red lamp, shining
afar over the apothecary's door;
which, while it does so, reminds us also
that there is help for them to be had. I
see him now, the pale blinker suppressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the conscious injustice of his anger at
being roused by the apprentice, and fumbling
himself out of the house, in hoarseness
and great-coat, resolved to make the
sweetness of the Christmas bill indemnify
him for the bitterness of the moment.</p>

<p>But we shall be getting too much into
the interior of the houses. By this time
the hackney-coaches have all left the
stands&mdash;a good symptom of their having
got their day's money. Crickets are
heard, here and there, amidst the embers
of some kitchen. A dog follows us.
Will nothing make him "go along"?
We dodge him in vain; we run; we
stand and "hish!" at him, accompanying
the prohibition with dehortatory gestures,
and an imaginary picking up of a stone.
We turn again, and there he is vexing
our skirts. He even forces us into an
angry doubt whether he will not starve, if
we do not let him go home with us. Now
if we could but lame him without being
cruel; or if we were only an overseer, or
a beadle, or a dealer in dog-skin; or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
political economist, to think dogs unnecessary.
Oh! come, he has turned a
corner, he has gone: we think we see
him trotting off at a distance, thin and
muddy, and our heart misgives us. But
it was not our fault; we were not "hishing"
at the time. His departure was
lucky, for he had got our enjoyments into
a dilemma; our "article" would not
have known what to do with him. These
are the perplexities to which your sympathisers
are liable. We resume our way,
independent and alone; for we have no
companion this time, except our never-to-be-forgotten
and ethereal companion, the
reader. A real arm within another's puts
us out of the pale of walking that is to
be made good. It is good already. A
fellow-pedestrian is company&mdash;is the
party you have left; you talk and laugh,
and there is no longer anything to be contended
with. But alone, and in bad
weather, and with a long way to go, here
is something for the temper and spirits to
grapple with and turn to account; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
accordingly we are booted and buttoned
up, an umbrella over our heads, the rain
pelting upon it, and the lamp-light shining
in the gutters; "mudshine," as an artist
of our acquaintance used to call it, with a
gusto of reprobation. Now, walk cannot
well be worse; and yet it shall be nothing
if you meet it heartily. There is a pleasure
in overcoming obstacles; mere action
is something; imagination is more; and
the spinning of the blood, and vivacity of
the mental endeavour, act well upon one
another, and gradually put you in a state
of robust consciousness and triumph.
Every time you set down your leg you
have a respect for it. The umbrella is
held in the hand like a roaring trophy.</p>

<p>We are now reaching the country:
the fog and rain are over; and we meet
our old friends the watchmen, staid,
heavy, indifferent, more coat than man,
pondering, yet not pondering, old but not
reverend, immensely useless. No; useless
they are not; for the inmates of the
houses think them otherwise, and in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
imagination they do good. We do not
pity the watchmen as we used. Old age
often cares little for regular sleep. They
could not be sleeping perhaps if they were
in their beds; and certainly they would
not be earning. What sleep they get is
perhaps sweeter in the watch-box,&mdash;a
forbidden sweet; and they have a sense
of importance, and a claim on the persons
in-doors, which, together with the amplitude
of their coating, and the possession
of the box itself, make them feel themselves,
not without reason, to be "somebody."
They are peculiar and official.
Tomkins is a cobbler as well as they;
but then he is no watchman. He cannot
speak to "things of night;" nor bid
"any man stand in the king's name."
He does not get fees and gratitude from
the old, the infirm, and the drunken; nor
"let gentlemen go;" nor is he "a parish-man."
The churchwardens don't speak
to him. If he put himself ever so much
in the way of "the great plumber," he
would not say, "How do you find yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Tomkins?"&mdash;"An ancient and quiet
watchman." Such he was in the time of
Shakespeare, and such he is now. Ancient,
because he cannot help it; and
quiet, because he will not help it, if possible;
his object being to procure quiet
on all sides, his own included. For this
reason he does not make too much noise
in crying the hour, nor is offensively particular
in his articulation. No man shall
sleep the worse for him, out of a horrid
sense of the word "three." The sound
shall be three, four, or one, as suits their
mutual convenience.</p>

<p>Yet characters are to be found even
among watchmen. They are not all mere
coat, and lump, and indifference. By-the-way,
what do they think of in general?
How do they vary the monotony of their
ruminations from one to two, and from
two to three, and so on? Are they comparing
themselves with the unofficial
cobbler; thinking of what they shall
have for dinner to-morrow; or what they
were about six years ago; or that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
lot is the hardest in the world, as insipid
old people are apt to think, for the pleasure
of grumbling; or that it has some
advantages nevertheless, besides fees; and
that if they are not in bed, their wife is?</p>

<p>Of characters, or rather varieties among
watchmen, we remember several. One
was a Dandy Watchman, who used to
ply at the top of Oxford Street, next the
park. We called him the dandy, on
account of his utterance. He had a
mincing way with it, pronouncing the <em>a</em>
in the word "past" as it is in <em>hat</em>, making
a little preparatory hem before he spoke,
and then bringing out his "past ten" in a
style of genteel indifference; as if, upon
the whole, he was of that opinion.</p>

<p>Another was the Metallic Watchman,
who paced the same street towards Hanover
Square, and had a clang in his voice
like a trumpet. He was a voice and
nothing else; but any difference is something
in a watchman.</p>

<p>A third, who cried the hour in Bedford
Square, was remarkable in his calling for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
being abrupt and loud. There was a
fashion among his tribe just come up at
that time, of omitting the words "past"
and "o'clock," and crying only the number
of the hour. I know not whether a
recollection I have of his performance one
night is entire matter of fact, or whether
any subsequent fancies of what might
have taken place are mixed up with it;
but my impression is, that as I was turning
the corner into the square with a friend,
and was in the midst of a discussion in
which numbers were concerned, we were
suddenly startled, as if in solution of it,
by a brief and tremendous outcry of&mdash;<span class="smcap">One</span>.
This paragraph ought to have been
at the bottom of the page, and the word
printed abruptly round the corner.</p>

<p>A fourth watchman was a very singular
phenomenon, a <em>Reading</em> Watchman. He
had a book, which he read by the light of
his lantern; and instead of a pleasant,
gave you a very uncomfortable idea of
him. It seemed cruel to pitch amidst so
many discomforts and privations one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
had imagination enough to wish to be
relieved from them. Nothing but a sluggish
vacuity befits a watchman.</p>

<p>But the oddest of all was the <em>Sliding</em>
Watchman. Think of walking up a
street in the depth of a frosty winter,
with long ice in the gutters, and sleet over
head, and then figure to yourself a sort of
bale of a man in white coming sliding
towards you with a lantern in one hand,
and an umbrella over his head. It was
the oddest mixture of luxury and hardship,
of juvenility and old age! But this
looked agreeable. Animal spirits carry
everything before them; and our invincible
friend seemed a watchman for
Rabelais. Time was run at and butted
by him like a goat. The slide seemed to
bear him half through the night at once;
he slipped from out of his box and his
commonplaces at one rush of a merry
thought, and seemed to say "Everything's
in imagination&mdash;here goes the
whole weight of my office."</p>

<p>But we approach our home. How still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the trees! How deliciously asleep the
country! How beautifully grim and nocturnal
this wooded avenue of ascent
against the cold white sky! The watchmen
and patrols, which the careful citizens
have planted in abundance within a mile
of their doors, salute us with their "Good
mornings"&mdash;not so welcome as we pretend;
for we ought not to be out so late;
and it is one of the assumptions of these
fatherly old fellows to remind us of it.
Some fowls, who have made a strange
roost in a tree, flutter as we pass them&mdash;another
pull up the hill, unyielding; a
few strides on a level; and <em>there</em> is the
light in the window, the eye of the warm
soul of the house&mdash;one's home. How
particular, and yet how universal, is that
word; and how surely does it deposit
every one for himself in his own nest!</p>
